# No more Telegram

**TL;DR: I've deleted my Telegram account.**

Why did I use Telegram in the first place?

I didn't have this messenger at all. But after the full-scale ruSSian invasion of Ukraine, I needed a fast way to follow the news. And like it or not, Telegram was the fastest channel at the time. Don't ask me why so many people in Ukraine use it - it's just a fact.

So I used the "best" available tool, fully aware of who controls this shithole.
After about six months of endless, horrifying news, I unsubscribed from all news channels. It was simply too much. But I still had a few chats with friends, and I didn't want to lose that communication channel.

At the same time, I kept running into more and more information about Telegram's insecurity and its ties to the Kremlin. If you're curious, check out [Kremlingram.org](https://www.kremlingram.org/en).

The funny (and ugly) part: I knew all of this. And I kept using it anyway - even if only minimally.

So what finally triggered me?

Honestly: nothing special.

Telegram had been on my "remove someday" list forever. Yesterday, I just decided: f**k it. I didn't need another reason. I just needed to do it.

## Summary

1. I shouldn't have used this app at all
2. Too much news seriously damages my mental health
3. There are plenty of other messengers - just use any non-ruSSian one
