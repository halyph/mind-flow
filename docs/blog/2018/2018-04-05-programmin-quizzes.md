# Programming Quizzes
<!-- tags: ruby, scala, javascript, haskell -->

Many years ago there was a site with collection of *Ruby Quizzes*: http://rubyquiz.com.

>*What Is Ruby Quiz?*
>
>Ruby Quiz is a weekly programming challenge for Ruby programmers

Idea is superb. So, I have decided to look around and collect here similar _resources_:

- [*Ruby Quiz*: 1 - 156 quizzes](http://rubyquiz.com)
  - ["Best of Ruby Quiz" by _James Edward Gray II_](https://pragprog.com/titles/fr_quiz/index.html). This book contains 25 problems from Ruby Quiz
- [*Ruby Quiz*: 157 - 234 quizzes](http://rubyquiz.strd6.com)
- [*Haskell* Quiz](https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell_Quiz)
- [*S-99: Ninety-Nine Scala Problems*: 99 quizzes](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99)
- [*JavaScript* snippets that you can understand in 30 seconds or less](https://30secondsofcode.org).
This huge list of snippets is not like "original" Ruby Quiz, but it might be used as quiz list.

The current list is not very impressive. But, I am going to maintain it and I hope it will be bigger.

The last list is not a quiz, but contains _"a list of practical projects that anyone can solve in any programming language"_: https://github.com/karan/Projects
