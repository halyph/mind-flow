# Thoughts about Blogging
> | blog |

I started blogging in 2009 using [Blogger.com](https://www.blogger.com). I had been using it from 2009 till 2014.
In total, I wrote there 116 posts (the last one I don't count), see grouped by year below:

- 2014 (8)
- 2013 (29)
- 2012 (32)
- 2011 (26)
- 2010 (14)
- 2009 (7)

I do not remember the reason "why I started blogging". But, the posts were/are not so good. (You can check it [halyph.blogspot.com](https://halyph.blogspot.com/))

Then I decided to move away from **Blogger** platform and use **Github Pages** as a blog hosting platform. In that time [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) looks appealing.
Check out my post [2014-09-07 - Migration to Octopress](../2014/2014-09-07-migration-to-octopress.md) about this "great" migration.

**Octopress** has very nice features. The most attractive for me was the markdown as a source for my posts. I thought it will speed up the post creation and give a boost for creativity.

So, I wrote 22 posts from 2014 till 2015.

- 2015 (18)
- 2014 (4)

Also, I tried to migrate all posts from **Blogger** to new engine. I did it. And it was a fail. **Octopress** could not handle big amount of pages. Don't get me wrong. It can render all these pages, but it was painfully slow. And it has pieced me off.

Then I though about migration from Octopress to [JBake](https://jbake.org/). This engine supports [Asciidoc](https://asciidoctor.org/) and [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) formats. Wow, I need this. ðŸ˜‰ New tool and new post's format (*Asciidoc*) helps me to be productive. LOL

Well, something was really better: the speed of page rendering, re-rendering and *Asciidoc* is much powerful format. I was happy. I could create much more complicated posts, with different components (tables, cool lists, quotes, etc). At the beginning it was fun, but I've been spending a lot of time in **Asciidoc** instead of writing the actual content. And here is a BIG F-A-I-L ðŸ’£

I created 10 posts from 2015 till 2018:

- 2016 (5)
- 2017 (2)
- 2018 (3)

So, I've decided to reflect on my blogging and what it is for me:

- I like to write in my private wiki, but do not share it with the world. And I write a lot. It's not something super useful, but it might be interesting for somebody

- I cared about content. But why did I produced so poor content or no content at all (see period 2016-2018)?

- Markdown format is not perfect, but it gives a freedom for writing. It's super simple and support "mind flow" approach for content creation

- I don't need to use super complicated blog engine. Pure Github repo as a blog is good for me

- Since now, I will write for myself only. Anybody can read and gain something from it. It won't be a traditional blogging. It will be a personal (but *public*) wiki/notes/thoughts

Let's see how it will be implemented in 2019!!!
