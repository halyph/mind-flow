# My reflection on "Programming Achievements: How to Level Up as a Developer"
> | learning | language |

Recently, I've read an amazing blog post ["Programming Achievements: How to Level Up as a Developer"](http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2011/08/09/programming-achievements-how-to-level-up-as-a-developer/). Also, it worth to read comments to this post, they are really interesting, subjective and personal. But, in any case you'll get something to think about. How to measure your own professional achievements, different ways for improvements and some start point for planning all these stuff.  
  
The author suggests to use GitHub Gist as a natural way of improvements to keep them tracking. So, I've just forked his gist and performed several initial changes (see [https://gist.github.com/1141765](https://gist.github.com/1141765)):
