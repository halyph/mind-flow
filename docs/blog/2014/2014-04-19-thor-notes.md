# Thor notes
> | ruby |

Some time ago I used [Thor] for one [CLI] application. I
investigated several tools, but picked Thor because of its simplicity
and easy to star. In general you would need only the [official
documentation][Thor]. But, I used [Bundler][] as real sample of Thor
usage also.  
  
Here is the list of articles, notes about Thor which might be helpful:
