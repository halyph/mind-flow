# Switching to Textmate 2
> | textmate |

Recently I've decided to switch from Sublime Text editor to [TextMate 2](http://macromates.com). At the beginning of [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) "era" it was the sexiest text editor in the world. But, at that time, I was a Windows user ;-)

I was inspired by [Venkat Subramaniam](http://blog.agiledeveloper.com/) to make this switch in 2014. Dr. Venkant is using Textmate during his conference live coding for years. 

Additional argument for switching is the fact that Textmate 2 is [open sourced](https://github.com/textmate/textmate).

Here is the list of articles which I highly recommend for Textmate newcomers:
