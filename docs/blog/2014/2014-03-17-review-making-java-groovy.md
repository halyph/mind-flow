# Review: Making Java Groovy
> | book | review | groovy |

I can say that this book is special. It’s not a Groovy “cookbook”.
You won’t find tons of tricky recipes around Groovy. You won’t learn
black art of Groovy meta programming. Strange, doesn’t it. :-) Then why
you should read it. Or who should read this book?  
  
The answer is very simple - Every Java programmer who wants to be productive in daily work must read this book. The author [Ken Kousen](http://www.amazon.com/Ken-Kousen/e/B003NUYREE) did really great job showing different aspects of Groovy as a language, tool and ecosystem. The reader will understand that there are tons of different appliances of Groovy:  

- Groovy scripting (@Grab)
- Gradle, Maven/Ant automation
- Groovy as prototyping language: REST, DB, etc.
- Web micro-frameworks
- Testing: Spock, mocks
- Java/Groovy integration
- JSON/XML manipulation

The most important thing is to understand that Groovy should **NOT** be
used only with Grails. Java programmers must re-discover Groovy as super
pragmatic language. Everything which is written in Java can be written
in Groovy. Save your time and automate with Groovy.
