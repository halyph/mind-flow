# Personal Techradar for Programming Languages - 2023 H1

This **Techradar 2023 H1** is very subjective and based on my current feeling/decision for 2023.

I've decided to change something in my work arsenal and use Go as work-horse programming language along with Java/Scala.
Partially it's because I want working with something non-JVM to expand my professional arsenal.

Also, you might noticed that Python dominates other domains (see [Python is the second best language for anything](../2022/2022-12-20-py_2nd_best_language_for_anything.md)), it's true and I want to keep this status quo for 2023.

There is one strange domain "Functional Programming". It's not something work-related, it's just things I am interested in and I still want to continue using Scala for this.
There are much more interesting/esoteric FP languages like *Haskell*, *Clojure*, *OCaml*, *Elixir*, etc., but I believe that Scala has enough blank spots I need to cover.
