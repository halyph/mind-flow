# Stockholm Syndrome and Programming Languages
> | thoughts |

[Stockholm syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome) is a proposed condition or theory that tries to explain why hostages sometimes develop a psychological bond with their captors.

Today I'd like to talk about *Stockholm syndrome* related to programming languages.

We can apply the following phases (in terms of develper's experience) to every programming language:

1. I am learning it
2. I use it every day
3. I am occasional user or I know a bit
4. I used it in the past

In general when we are learning something new it's an excitement. We tend to like opening a new horizon. We prefer to reveal every new feature just because it's "new". But then we spend more and more time with a programming language and discover different language's nuances, tricks, corner cases etc.

The most interesting that there is no perfect language. But software engineers tend to emotionally attanch to programming language*s* and see only positive side of it. I saw/see such behaviour in several communities.  
When people spent so many time with beloved language they couldn't see quirks and design issues. Their common reply to obvious criticism is: "it's not Pythonic", "it's not Go-way" or "we are doing this in X-lang differently" and so on.

Another interesting sign is "us vs them", "our community is better".

> P.S. generalization is bad, just switch on critical thinking ðŸ˜‰

I noticed a distinct characteristic, the *stockholm syndrome* can be applied to software engineer:

  1. who spends majority of time with minimal number of programming languages and can't compare with others languages
  2. who spent last several years (e.g. 4+ years) with only one language and convinced himself in language perfection

So he has a limited perspective (or bias) and honestly believe that "his" language is the best.

ðŸ’Š I *healed* this syndrome many years ago when decided to **learn** and **use** on daily basis many programming languages. Important is "to use on daily basis", because only learning or occasional usage wasn't helpful for me.
