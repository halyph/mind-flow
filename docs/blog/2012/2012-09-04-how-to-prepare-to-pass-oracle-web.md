> | java |

I've already posted the [Certification Result report on coderanch](http://www.coderanch.com/t/591591/sr/certification/Passed-OCPJWCD).  
Here are the main resources for preparation for this exam:  

* Book: "[Head First Servlets and JSP", 2nd Edition, By Bryan Basham, Kathy Sierra, Bert Bates](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596516680.do)
* [Enthuware mock exams](http://enthuware.com/index.php/mock-exams/oracle-certified-expert/oce-jsp-servlet-mock-questions), very nice software with tons of questions. I definitely recommend it if you'd like to pass this exam
* Nikos [Free SCWCD Mock exams](http://nikojava.wordpress.com/tag/scwcd/) were very helpful during the reading the HFSJ book 
* Piotr Nowicki's [Java EE 6 SCWCD Mock Exam](http://piotrnowicki.com/2011/03/jee-6-scwcd-mock-questions/) 
* [Servlets 3.0 Final Release specification](http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/mrel/jsr315/index.html)
