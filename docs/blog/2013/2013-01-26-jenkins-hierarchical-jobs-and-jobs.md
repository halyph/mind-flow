# Jenkins hierarchical jobs and jobs status aggregation
> | jenkins | ci |
  
As you probably know, Jenkins is highly configurable CI server. We can setup different custom build process. And I'm going to share some approach I've been using to setup the hierarchy of Jenkins' jobs.  
  
Here is use case.  

1. We have one main entry job which is invoked to start the whole build process.
2. This job can have from one to many child jobs. (Level 2)
3. Each child job can have from one to many child jobs, aslo. (Level 3)
4. The main idea is to collect/aggregate all children jobs' status into main entry job.

See sample screenshot below which visualize the general idea. Here:  

* **Main\_Job** is single entry job, which must contain all sibling jobsÂ  statuses
* **Job\_Set\_1** and **Job\_Set\_2** are two child jobs
* **Build\_\[1-4\]** are child jobs of **Job\_Set\_1**
* **Tests\_\[1-3\]** are child jobs of **Job\_Set\_2**

Now, we should use some Jenkins plugin to build such hierarchy. I've been using [Multijob Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Multijob+Plugin).  
See below screenshots of configuration for:

Main\_Job/configure

Job\_Set\_1/configure

Job\_Set\_2/configure 

![](2013-01-26-jenkins-hierarchical-jobs-and-jobs/clip4.png)

But, it's not enough. We have to aggregate statuses into **Main\_Job** from all sibling jobs. I've been using patched [Groovy Postbuild Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Groovy+Postbuild+Plugin). Modified plugin is located here [https://github.com/halyph/groovy-postbuild-plugin](https://github.com/halyph/groovy-postbuild-plugin)  
  
Groovy Postbuild Plugin allows us to write groovy scripts for job's Post-build Actions. This script has access to whole Jenkins environment and can consume functionality of all installed Jenkins plugin:

Here is the source of this script:  

```groovy
import hudson.model.*
import com.tikal.jenkins.plugins.multijob.*;

void log(msg) {
  manager.listener.logger.println(msg)
}

threshold = Result.SUCCESS

void aggregate_results() {
    failed = false

    mainJob = manager.build.getProject().getName()
    job = hudson.model.Hudson.instance.getItem(mainJob)

    log "---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
    log "Aggregated status report"
    log "---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

    log("${mainJob}    #${manager.build.getNumber()} - ${manager.build.getResult()}")

    job.getLastBuild().getSubBuilds().each { subBuild->
      subJob = subBuild.getJobName() 
      subJobNumber = subBuild.getBuildNumber()
      job = hudson.model.Hudson.instance.getItem(subBuild.getJobName())
      log "${subJob}   #${subJobNumber} - ${job.getLastCompletedBuild().getResult()}"
      log job.getLastCompletedBuild().getLog()

      //println subBuild
      dePhaseJob = hudson.model.Hudson.instance.getItem(subBuild.getJobName())
      dePhaseJobBuild = dePhaseJob.getBuildByNumber(subBuild.getBuildNumber())
      dePhaseJobBuild.getSubBuilds().each { childSubBuild ->
        try {
            log "   ${childSubBuild.jobName}"

            job = hudson.model.Hudson.instance.getItem(childSubBuild.getJobName())
            build = job.getBuildByNumber(childSubBuild.getBuildNumber())

            indent = "  "    
            log "${indent} #${build.getNumber()}  - ${build.getResult()}" 
            log build.getLog()

            if(!failed && build.getResult().isWorseThan(threshold) ) {
              failed = true
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {    
            log("ERROR: ${e.getMessage()}")
            failed = true
        }
      }
    }

    if(failed) {manager.build.setResult(hudson.model.Result.FAILURE)}
}

try {
  aggregate_results()
} catch(Exception e) {
  log("ERROR: ${e.message}")
  log("ERROR: Failed Status report aggregation")
  manager.build.setResult(hudson.model.Result.FAILURE)
}
```


You can find it on GitHub Gist also: [https://gist.github.com/4610274](https://gist.github.com/4610274).

This script is pretty dumb. It simply extracts (prints in Main\_Job console) the next info for each child jobs:  

* job name
* build number
* build result (status)
* build log

Also, it has ability to set the **Main\_Job** status based on statuses of child jobs. See `threshold` variable in script.  

And aggregated report looks like this:  

```

So, what are the benefits of such jobs status aggregation and Groovy post-processing:  

* we have jobs status in one place
* e-mail notification sent from **Main\_Job** contains this status
* ability to implement any custom post-processing logic
* ability to re-use the other plugins features via groovy scrip
