## My thoughts

*TL;DR* Lightbend decided to change Akka license from Apache 2.0 to Business Source License (BSL) v1.1.

> The BSL is a “Source Available” license that freely allows using the code for development and other non-production work such as testing. Production use of the software requires a commercial license from Lightbend. The commercial license will be available at no charge for early-stage companies (less than US $25 million in annual revenue). By enabling early-stage companies to use Akka in production for free, we hope to continue to foster the innovation synonymous with the startup adoption of Akka.

It was announced 2 days ago (September 7, 2022), I expected a shit-storm and decided to wait and read comments (see links above).

I have nothing against Lightbend's decision.

I used **Akka-http**, **Akka-Streams** and **Play Framework**. I like Akka-http for it's simplicity. Life is unpredictable and we all must adjust our plans.

I will not recommend my team or my current and future employer to use Akka. There are several other libraries and frameworks which can replace Akka.

I see the following alternatives for Scala: [Typelevel](https://typelevel.org/projects/) stack or [ZIO](https://zio.dev). One downside of *ZIO* it's his opinionated approach.
For now, I have decided to check *Typelevel* stack.

But, in case of failure on Scala front, I have Java backup - **Spring Boot** and *Co*. People are saying that Java 18 is cool.

## Historical Notes

I forgot to mention that Lightbend has stopped [Lagom](https://www.lagomframework.com) active development and made [Playframework](https://www.playframework.com) community-led project.
