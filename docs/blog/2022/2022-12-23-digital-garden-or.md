# Blog, Digital Garden, Wiki. FTW?
> | blog |

See my previous post about blogging [Rethinking Bloging](2022-08-20-rethinking-bloging.md).

Recently, I have discovered interesting idea [Digital Garden](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/digital_garden/).

> **Digital Garden** is a method of storing and maintaining knowledge in an maintainable, scalable and searchable way. They are also known as second brains.
>
> Unlike in common blogging where you write an article and forget about it, posts are treated as plants in various stages of growth and nurturing. Some might wither and die, and others will flourish and provide a source of continued knowledge for the gardener and folks in the community that visit.

So, for me it sounds like personal *Wiki*, but for external audience :-).

But, I don't want to stick to "Digital Garden" as is and want to have both ideas simultaneously: Blog and Wiki ("Digital Garden").

Blog is kinda snapshot of your ideas. It's very interesting to read it in retrospective.

Regarding *Wiki*, currently it's very small (Ã  la initial state) and "dirty". I will be evolve with one big disclamer: "This *Wiki* is for me, but you can read it as well". I.e. I don't plan to polish every article to make it perfect. I just make a note, update here and there and that's it.

I have checked other Digital Gartens (see [here](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/digital_garden/#existing-digital-gardens)) and must say ppl invested a lot. Some use fancy tools, typography etc. I am not ready yet invest so much in design, it's better for me to have content.
