# Python is the second best language for anything

**Disclaimer**: It's another blah-blah post, feel free to read Hacker News :-P it will be more useful for you.

What other programming languages do I associate with Python, or to be precise what other scripting languages? I would say the following:

- [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language))
- [Groovy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Groovy)
- [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
- [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl)
- [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP)
- [Lua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language))
- [Tcl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl)
- [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) (_and similar shell scipting languages_)
- [Powershell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell)
- [VBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications)
- [Autohokey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
- [AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com)
- [newLISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewLISP)
- [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language))
- [Matlab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB)
- [Maple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_(software))

Actually, I decided to make this list only as an exercise for myself, to identify from a historical perspective what I touched during all these years. 

I used some of these languages at the university or early in my career. I.e. I don't know the status quo for them, new features, their communities, etc. But all of them somehow build Python-association in my brain in a way I can use Python instead of them and be "happy".
If you look closer at this list you will notice some domain-specific language (like GUI automation, scripting, and math tools).

But the true **Python** competitor in general sense is **Ruby**. These two are very similar in terms of exploitation, and I preferred Ruby before my personal Python era began.

I was not too fond of Python. But since everybody around me has been using Python in some or another way, I decided to use it as well, to simplify knowledge/tool sharing, contribution to other tools, etc.
Even today, I am not a big Python fan, but there is convenience: a massive amount of libs, books, blogs, etc. It's like a universal hammer for everything.

So, what does it mean _"Python is the second best language for anything"_ for me? 

It means I will start prototyping any simple things, or throw-away scripts in Python. Even if I don't know the domain I am 99% sure there is at least some library for my current problem.

There are several exceptions:

- **Web**: Javascript/Typescript
- **System Programming**: C
- **Back-End**: Go, Java, Scala
- **CLI**: Go
- **Desktop**: Java

The following domains will be covered by Python ([PoC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept), my personal projects):

- Scripting
- Infrastructure
- Machine Learning/Data Science/Data Analysis/Data Engineering
- CLI: *when I don't need to distribute the app*

Again, Python is not the best language in the world, it definitely has some sort of ugliness, but it's popular. And I accepted this.
