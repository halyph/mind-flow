# Machine Learning and Data Science MOOCs
> | data science | machine learning | mooc |

There are a lot of difference Courses and Specialization on Coursera. But bookmarking (absent) and search is not very convenient. That's why I've decided to track all interested resources here and a reference for easier navigation. I hope these courses will transform into knowledge ü§ì
