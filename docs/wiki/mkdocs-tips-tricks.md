# Mkdocs - Tips and Tricks

## Plugins

- [**mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin**](https://github.com/lukasgeiter/mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin) sorts pages in navigation section (descending order)
- [**mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin**](https://github.com/timvink/mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin) adds the date on which a Markdown file was last updated at the bottom of each page

## Sample Mkdocs site

Here is a collections of MkDocs-based sites and repos for my inspiration
