## Undo the Last Commit

[Source][git-reset]

### soft reset

The `--soft` option means that you will not lose the uncommitted changes you may have.

```shell
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

### hard reset

If you want to reset to the last commit and also remove all unstaged changes, you can use the `--hard` option

```shell
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```
