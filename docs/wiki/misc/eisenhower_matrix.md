# Eisenhower Matrix

> "I have two kinds of problems: the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent." — Dwight D. Eisenhower

The core principle behind the Eisenhower Matrix is the distinction between **important** and **urgent** tasks.

**Urgent** tasks are time-sensitive and demand your attention. They’re tasks you feel obligated to address. Focusing on urgent tasks puts you in a reactive mindset, which can make you feel defensive, rushed, and narrowly focused.

**Important** tasks contribute to your long-term mission, values, and goals. They may not yield immediate results (making them easy to neglect). Sometimes important tasks are also urgent — but usually not. Focusing on important tasks puts you in a responsive mindset, which can make you feel calm, rational, and open to new ideas.

The Eisenhower Matrix is divided into four parts:

- Quadrant 1: Important and urgent / Do
- Quadrant 2: Important but not urgent / Schedule
- Quadrant 3: Urgent but not important / Delegate
- Quadrant 4: Not important, not urgent / Delete
