## Overview

- *Popular*
  - [**Java Collections Framework**](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/package-summary.html)
  - [**Apache Commons Collections**](https://github.com/apache/commons-collections)
  - [**Guava**](https://github.com/google/guava)  is a set of core Java libraries from Google that includes new collection types (such as multimap and multiset), immutable collections, a graph library, and utilities for concurrency, I/O, hashing, primitives, strings, and more! It is widely used on most Java projects within Google, and widely used by many other companies as well.
  - [**Eclipse Collections**](https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections)
  - [**fastutil**](https://fastutil.di.unimi.it) extends the Java Collections Framework by providing type-specific maps, sets, lists, and queues with a small memory footprint and fast access and insertion; it provides also big (64-bit) arrays, sets, and lists, sorting algorithms, fast, practical I/O classes for binary and text files, and facilities for memory mapping large files.
  - [**JCTools**](https://github.com/JCTools/JCTools) Java Concurrency Tools for the JVM. This project aims to offer some concurrent data structures currently missing from the JDK.
- *Graph*
  - [**JGraphT**](https://github.com/jgrapht/jgrapht) is Java class library that provides mathematical graph-theory objects and algorithms
  - [**JUNG**](https://github.com/jrtom/jung) is the Java Universal Network/Graph Framework
- *Persistent collections*
  - [**vavr**](https://github.com/vavr-io/vavr) provides persistent collections, functional abstractions for error handling, concurrent programming, pattern matching and much more
- *Personal*
  - [**kevin-wayne/algs4**](https://github.com/kevin-wayne/algs4/) is a repo for "Algorithms" 4th edition book's code and libraries
  - [**java-algorithms-implementation**](https://github.com/phishman3579/java-algorithms-implementation) sample algorithms and data structures implemented in Java
  - [**williamfiset/Algorithms**](https://github.com/williamfiset/Algorithms) is a collection of algorithms and data structures
