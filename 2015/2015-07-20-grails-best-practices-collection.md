# Grails 2.x best practices collection
> | groovy | grails |

Recently, I had a pleasure to look into several Grails v.2.3+ projects. Despite the fact that I'm not a Grails developer I discovered some anti-patterns.
Then I started looking around to find some *Grails projects best practices*. And  they are well known and people still doing mistakes.
However, I've found several nice resources and I'm (_going to quite_) quoting them here. I keep references back to original source and use "copy-paste" approach to have aggregated post in single place.
