# DevoxxPL - Krakow, 2015 - Report
> | conference | java |

This summer I've decided to attend my 1<sup>st</sup> foreign conference - [DevoxxPL - Krakow, Poland, 22-25 June 2015](http://devoxx.pl). It was very important experience, because I wanted to compare it with our local Ukrainian conferences. Long story short - the quality is equal. Any conference is based on speakers (I'd like to be "Captain Obvious"). And even awesome conference location can't make conference **great**.

So, I've attended the next talks:

## Day 1

- **"The Silver Bullet Syndrome"** by [Hadi Hariri](http://hadihariri.com/)

  - It was really nice case study about building project with Scala. Pros&cons were "honestly" highlighted.

- **"You're an Architect...Now What?"** by [Nathaniel Schutta](https://twitter.com/ntschutta)
