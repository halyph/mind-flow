name: Build Test (No Deploy)

# Purpose: Validate MkDocs builds without deploying to production
#
# Why this workflow exists:
# - Provides fast feedback on PRs and feature branches
# - Tests that site builds successfully before merging to master
# - Does NOT deploy - safe for testing changes without affecting production
# - Faster than ci.yaml (uses shallow clone, fetch-depth: 1)
#
# When it runs:
# - Pull requests (automatic)
# - Pushes to any branch except master (automatic)
# - Manual trigger via workflow_dispatch (on-demand)
#
# Artifacts:
# - Uploads built site as artifact for manual verification
# - Artifact available for 5 days in GitHub Actions tab
# - Download to inspect generated HTML locally if needed
#
# Difference from ci.yaml:
# - ci.yaml: Deploys to production (halyph.github.io) on master branch
# - build-test.yaml: Build-only validation, no deployment
#
# Note: You may see warnings about shallow git fetch affecting revision dates.
# This is expected and acceptable for testing. Production (ci.yaml) uses full history.
