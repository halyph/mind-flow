# Thoughts about Audiobooks
> | book |

Last 2020 year was "special" in many senses. But, today I'd like to talk about audiobooks.
I decided to listen as much I can - 22 books.  
A vital remark - I've been listening to something (podcasts, audiobooks) while walking,
i.e. only outside, never at home.

## Title selection

I was sure (and still is) that audiobooks aren't suitable for something serious (tech, science).
That's why I picked some stories about hackers and cybersecurity, companies and their "path to success", IT-history, self-development, and similar.
As you can see, there is nothing "important" and it's easy to listen on the walk.

But, even this doesn't work for me. 70% of all books were interesting, but I almost forgot the content. My head cleaned out all information.
So, I pay for audiobooks, but the result is as after some ordinary podcast. I continued asking myself "what is the value"? Unfortunately, I concluded
that there is no real value in audiobooks for me :-(. Waste of time and money.

## Conclusion

It's better to concentrate on interesting podcasts than on audiobook. The audiobooks can't replace a real book. I can't speed up content consumption via audio.
The audiobook is like entertaining, nothing serious.
