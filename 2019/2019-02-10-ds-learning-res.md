# Data Science Learning Resources
> **tag**: | data science | video |

I've been following [Python Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC68KSmHePPePCjW4v57VPQg) YouTube channel by [Giles McMullen](https://twitter.com/GilesMcMullen).
Mr. Giles has collected amazing collection of resources in the next video [Can you LEARN DATA SCIENCE for FREE? YES! I'll show you HOW!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTxyviU0Ddo). I do not like YouTube as a reference and copied all content here. Probably, I will comment/modify it based on my preferenes, but for now it is as is.
