# Lambda Days - Krakow, 2019 - Report
> | scala | conference | functional programming | haskell |

I attended [Lambda Days](http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019) conference (21-22 February, 2019) in Krakow, Poland.

So, what's so special in this conference? The main idea is to attend one conference to check different functional programming communities: Scala, Erlang, Haskell, Elixir, F#, Lisp, Clojure, OCaml, Elm, PureScript, etc. And it's amazing how different FP languages solve the same/similar problems.

Here is the list of talks I've attended (some talks have been excluded from this list because I don't like it at all):

## Day 1 (February 21, 2019)

Keynote: F# Code I Love by Don Syme
FP Design Patterns in Micro-Service Inter-Process Communication by Viačeslav Pozdniakov
Empowering the Quantum revolution with Q# by John Azariah
From Haskell to C#, A story of culture shocks and happy reunions by Øystein Kolsrud
Elm, Fable, and the Practical Implications of Programming Language Philosophy by Michael Newton
One year of using F# in production at SBTech by Anton Moldovan
(Dys)functional DDD by Jarek Ratajski

## Day 2 (February 22, 2019)

Scala superpowers: effortless domain driven design by Bartosz Mikulski
Effective Data Engineering using higher kinded types by Animesh Kumar
Fast & Functional by Michał Płachta
Behind collaborative text editing by Bartosz Sypytkowski
Teaching Functional Programming by Michael Sperber
