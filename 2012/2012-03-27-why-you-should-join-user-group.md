Here I'd like to highlight the most important benefits for me:

- **Networking** - ability to make social connections with developers from other companies
- **Learning** - it's the right place to learn something for free and improve you skills.
- **Knowledge sharing** - you shouldn't always take also you can give something to others. In our case it's your knowledge. Most people are very kind and really like to share own experience.
- **Public Visibility** - here you can promote yourself as passionate and well skilled developer
- **Job Opportunities** - you can find new contact which suggest a new job
- **Find Expert** - it's the right place to find the right people which might help you to solve some technical problems
- **Become an Expert** - it can happen
- **Meet Nice People** - just fact :)

If you have other nice benefits please add in comments.
