# State of numerical computation languages
> | computation |

When I was a student I spent a huge amount of time doing difference numerical computation with MATLAB and Maple. I must say I was falling in love with MATLAB. This environment, language and visualization possibilities were amazing and very powerful. I simply couldn't choose another stuff. It gave me a chance fully concentrate on engineering problems I had been trying to solve.  
  
But now I must admit that MATLAB is very expensive software. And we should look around for other open-source mathematical computation environments. Today I'm biased because I prefer to invest time in general purpose language then in specialized computation languages (like MATLAB, R).  
  
I've found very interested comparison: [Mathesaurus](http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/).  
Also, check these slides [Math synonyms](http://www.slideshare.net/halyph/math-synonyms).
  
Also, [Hyperpolyglot](http://hyperpolyglot.org/) provides nice comparison ["Numerical Analysis Software: Fortran, MATLAB, R, NumPy"](http://hyperpolyglot.org/numerical-analysis).  
  
Based on these two comparisons I've selected several factors for choosing the "right" numerical environments:  

1. Commercial or open-source
2. Visualization possibilities
3. Language itself (MATLAB, Maple, R, etc.): computational specific or general purpose (Python, Clojure/[Incanter](http://incanter.org/), etc. )
4. Integration with Fortran/C/C++ etc.
5. GUI features
