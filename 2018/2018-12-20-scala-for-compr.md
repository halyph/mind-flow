# [WIP] Note: Scala `for`-comprehensions
> | scala | video |

This is a complete copy of **Josh Suereth** & **Dick Wall** talk on *Scala World* conference: _"For: What is it good for? — Josh Suereth & Dick Wall"_ (see references).

Actually, I have found github repo with Jupiter notebooks. But, I don't like this format and decided to store these notes here.

    TODO - add NOTES
