# Resources for Practicing Coding Interview
> | interview |

Well, I've been reading many posts about technical interview preparation and many people suggesting different resources: sites, books, [youtube channels](2018-12-29-system-design-interview-prep.md).

I've decided to collect all of them based on my priority. It might be helpful in future. üòâ

***NOTE***: *This is [WIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_in_process) article and I will update it on regular basis*
