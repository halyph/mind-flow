# Ruby 3 and static typing
> | ruby |

[Ruby 3.0.0](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2020/12/25/ruby-3-0-0-released/) was released on Christmas Day in 2020.

The Ruby team is moving into the right direction with JIT and Concurency. But, another "new" feature spot my eyes - *Static Analysis*.  
I started using Ruby in 2007-2008 and I still remember the mood in Ruby-community at that time: **dynamic typing is cool, and static typing just sucks**. Time flies and even Ruby team decided to have some "Static types" features.

I am not sure whether it will help, since the Ruby community is not diversified as the Python community. IMHO Ruby equals to *Ruby on Rails*. Even PHP has a more diversified set of web frameworks: Laravel, Symfony, CodeIgniter, etc.  
And when I am looking at the Ruby community from 13 years perspective I can say it will be really hard to bring here *fresh air*. And *fresh air* it's not only yet another web framework, it's another problem domain.

## Interesting programming languages ratings

I like programming languages ratings and it in the future will be interesting to check these 2020 ratings, it's like a time machine.
