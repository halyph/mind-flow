# Personal Tech Radar - 2020 H2
> | python | java | scala |

Why "personal" Tech Radar? Well, [Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/de/radar) was "invented" by ThoughtWorks company
(I guess, and I have zero motivation to prove this).
It is used for companies technology landscape evaluation. So, how I can use this for personal technology set definition?

We are living in a very dynamic world. Things are changing very fast. Software engineers like to try new "silver bullet" here-and-there.
You know *"the grass is always greener on the other side*" ;-) So, it's important to follow some guidance even for own personal development,
especially in Programming Languages space.

I have a weakness look around and try new "shiny" programming languages. But, now, I don't see any value in this. It's a waste of time. Better to work on something fundamental like math, instead of learning new syntax every year or two.

So, some time ago I defined a list of programming languages I am willing to invest in wiht some reasonnings. **This** list is defined for **2020 H2**. And I can assume that for **2021 H1** it will be updated.

So, following Tech Radar tradition I need to select some criterias.

The Radar Ring Semantics as follows (in decreasing level of investment):

- **ADOPT**: technologies with broad adoption, in which I am willing to invest long-term
- **TRIAL**: captures all current experiments
- **ASSESS**: active, non-production assessments of promising technologies and trends
- **HOLD**: discouraged from broad adoption where I am not willing to invest further
- **NIL**: no ring assignment, captures previous assessments and findings for long-term documentation purposes

- **Domain**: Back-End, Scripting, Infrastructure, Web, Desktop, Machine Learning, System programming
