# Migration to Octopress
> | blog |

## Objectives

I've been blogging for several years (2009-2014) using Google Blogger [My old blogspot blog](http://halyph.blogspot.com ). It was a great experience. But, I always felt some discomfort.
I couldn't simply write without thinking how it will be rendered. I was distracted by blog engine. 

## Moving away

Additional inspiration for moving away came from the essay [Blogging Like a Hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html).
Finally, I made a decision to use GitHub Pages for blogging. There were two choices: [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) or [Octopress](http://octopress.org/). 
I picked Octopress because of the pre-bundled minimal required blogging features. *I.e.* it's not required the additional configuration to start blogging right away.

The official Octopress [documentation](http://octopress.org/docs/) has step-by-step guide for blog setup. It's very convenient and transparent.

## Theme

I didn't want to use the default Octopress theme (it's boring). Theme customization required some time. All others free themes are too complex, IMHO.

At the end I found this [theme](http://blog.justin.kelly.org.au/octopress-theme/) and applied it to my *new* blog. 

## Main features

Here I selected the main features which I like the most:

- markdown for blogging
- simple code snippets insertion
- full blog customization
- Ruby at the bottom (I love this language)
- ability to use your favorite text editor (Textmate in my case) for blogging

### Minor Issues

I've tried to migrate posts form my old blog to Octopress, tried different approaches. But, I had no success. Actually, I had ugly results, which should be manually fixed.

### P.S.

There are tons of different Static Site Generators, see the next resources:

- [Top Open-Source Static Site Generators](https://www.staticgen.com/)
- [Static Site Generators, The definitive listing of Static Site Generators â€” all 298 of them!](http://staticsitegenerators.net/)

But, Jekyll and Octopress are at the top.
