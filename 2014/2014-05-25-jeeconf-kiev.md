# JEEConf - Kyiv, 2014 - Report
> | conference | java |

I attended the forth [JEEConf](http://jeeconf.com), May 23-24, 2014. The situation in my country (Ukraine) is difficult that’s why I was amazed to see so many foreign speakers. The organizers did really tremendous work.

This year I divided topics by the next directions:

## Spring

* _Spring 4, Java EE 7 or Both? by Ivar Grimstad_ -- The main idea of the talk was to show similar and different parts of Spring 4 and Java EE 7. And have an ability easily identify when to use one or another. There are trade-offs and we should be aware of them.
* _Spring configuration: how to do it right (experience report), Mikalai Alimenkou_ -- Mikalai shared his experience related to Spring configs. Nice talk. I'm going to borrow some ideas ;-)
* _Spring the Ripper, by Evgeny Borisov_ -- It was the most dynamic talk at this conference. The presenter shown Spring life-cycle internals in action. Well done. It should be seen by every Spring dev :-)
	
## Frameworks

* *Apache Lucene/Solr Internals, by Anatoliy Sokolenko* -- I had no experience with these technologies. And it was really nice intro. Now I have some clue how it works.
* *Streamline your processes with jBPM 6, by Jiri Svitak* -- It was an into talk into jBPM 6. I had small experience with competitor framework [Activiti](http://activiti.org/). It's always interesting to see the similar framework's features.

## Java/JVM/Compiler

* *Java8: Stream Style, by Sergey Kuksenko* -- It was Java 8 Stream introduction. There were shown different stream features and approaches.
* *[What Heap Dumps Are Lying To You About, by Aleksey Shipilёv](http://shipilev.net/blog/2014/heapdump-is-a-lie/)* -- It's a very special talk related to Java "internals". Actually, this talk was about Java object size calculation and what happens under the hood.
* *Reflection Madness, by Heinz Kabutz* -- The presenter told us about Java reflection magic, when to use it and why it's dangerous.

## Miscellaneous
* *Tooling of a Test-Driven Developer, by Paweł Lipiński* -- There were highlighted two very interesting libraries for TDD on top of JUnit: [AssertJ](http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/) and [JUnitParams](https://code.google.com/p/junitparams/).Very interesting libraries
* *Web Apps in LISP!? EWW!, by Anatoly Polinsky* -- Here was shown different aspects of web development in Clojure for beginners. It's was real intro, but very interesting, especially when you'd like to spread your mind into alternative JVM-related communities.

It was very productive conference for me. I've got new portion of inspiration, new knowledge and passion to ordinary things.
